# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System (C++)

Welcome to my first C++ project â€” a **Student Management System** built using basic C++ concepts like structs, vectors, loops, and conditionals.  
Itâ€™s a simple **console-based application** designed for beginners learning data management in C++.

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Add new students (ID, Name, Age)  
âœ… Display all students in a clean list  
âœ… Interactive text-based menu  
âœ… Input validation and user-friendly messages

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How to use **structs** to group related data  
- How to store multiple records using **vectors**  
- How to create a **menu-driven loop**  
- How to handle user input and display output neatly

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Libraries:** iostream, vector, string  
- **Environment:** Any C++ compiler (GCC, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.)
